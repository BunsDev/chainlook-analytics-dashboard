ChainLook is a decentralized blockchain analytics tool based on TheGraph and IPFS.
<br />
You can create beautiful widgets and dashboards based on data from subgraphs. The configuration JSONs
for widgets and dashboards are stored in IPFS
<br />
Additionally, widgets can be build based on data from IPFS (json), Tableland, OrbitDB (in progress). In a way
ChainLook is a general purpose visualization tool for decentralized data.
